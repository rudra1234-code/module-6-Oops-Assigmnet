        "    The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "    Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class.\n",
        "    It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data. Access is typically controlled using access modifiers such as private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2.Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "    Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features.\n",
        "    It allows a user to interact with the object through a simplified interface without needing to understand the underlying complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3.Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "    Inheritance allows a class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or base class).\n",
        "\tIt promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    4.Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "\tPolymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\tIt can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism), enabling flexibility and dynamic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "    5.Composition (or Association)\n",
        "\n",
        "\tWhile not always explicitly listed, composition is a key principle in OOP where objects are built using references to other objects.\n",
        "\tIt describes a \"has-a\" relationship (e.g., a car has a steering wheel), enabling modular and scalable design.\n",
